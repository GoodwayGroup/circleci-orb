# circleci-orbs
Goodway CircleCI Orbs

## Getting Started

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run test`

## Dev Builds

For any non-master branch, CircleCI will build dev tags to be used for testing.

```
Orb `goodwaygroup/circleci-orb@dev:alpha` was published.
Note that your dev label `dev:alpha` can be overwritten by anyone in your organization.
Your dev orb will expire in 90 days unless a new version is published on the label `dev:alpha`.
Please note that this is an open orb and is world-readable.
```

See CircleCI build for more specific branch tags.
